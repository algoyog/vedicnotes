# Nakshatras

> **nak** - Night, **shatra** - Zone

> There are **27** nakshatras. As moon takes approx 27 days to move around the zodiac in average. we have this calibration.

 Moons exhaltation is in **Krithika**. This is a critical nakshatra for humans as humans have evolved 6th sense. *Gayathri mantra* is associated with this nakshatra.

> Each nakshatra is **13D20M** in angle, because, **360/27**. Each pada is 13D20M/4 = **3D20M**

Nakshatras generally represents human mind, thoughts, seekings, aspirations, intentions, etc. While Rasis represents physical manifestation.

Moon is lord of night, Sun is lord of the day.

> 9th house represents Father (sun)
>> A Rasi is 30D. So, 30/9 = 3D20M

> 4th house represents Mother (moon)
>> A Nakshatra is 13D20M. So 13,20/4 = 3D20M.

WE ARE JUST REPRESENTED BY **1 PADA**

> There are **4 padas** per nakshatra (total of 27 nakshatras). So **27*4 = 108**. There are **9 padas** per rasi(total of 12 rasis). So **9*12 = 108**

Each pada is associated with FEAW element in cyclic 1:1 association. For eg, Ashwini's 4 Padas has FEAW for each pada and Bharani 's 4 Padas has FEAW for each pada . Krithikas first pada is Fire, so the MAX number of fire padas is 3 in Mesham(Aries), So aries is fire influenced sign

## The Nakshatras

Trine - 9*4=36 padas, 120D. So grand trine. End of 36 padhas is Ganda(Radical)-Antha (End)

Bhur Bhuva Swa

Pushkara and Shunya nakshatra

**Janma Nakshatra** - What is happening outside [Outside World]. WHAT YOU WORKON.  For eg, 10 Downing Street is the Janma nakshatra of brit PM
> Look at the lord of moons placement. The nakshatra where moon is placed is the outside world for you. The lord will influence the life of the persons outside world. 

>> For eg. assume moon is in moola. Ketu is the lord, ketu is headless and introvert. It will make you look into and be spiritual.

>> For eg, if the moon is placed in Venus, marriage will help in life.

>> For eg, if the moon is placed in naks which is owned by rahu. The person should look to go out to foreign.

>> For eg. if moon is placed in moons naks. Take care of your family (home, work, etc)

**Lagna Nakshatra** - How You/your mind reacts [Inside world]. HOW YOU WORK. For eg, how will you work and you being differnt from Other primeminister will be due to Lagna.

**Soorya Nakshatra** - How you influence world affairs
