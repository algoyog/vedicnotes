# Nakshatras

> **nak** - Night, **shatra** - Zone

> There are **27** nakshatras. As moon takes approx 27 days to move around the zodiac in average. we have this calibration.

 Moons exhaltation is in **Krithika**. This is a critical nakshatra for humans as humans have evolved 6th sense. *Gayathri mantra* is associated with this nakshatra.

> Each nakshatra is **13D20M** in angle, because, **360/27**. Each pada is 13D20M/4 = **3D20M**

Nakshatras generally represents human mind, thoughts, seekings, aspirations, intentions, etc. While Rasis represents physical manifestation.

Moon is lord of night, Sun is lord of the day.

> 9th house represents Father (sun)
>> A Rasi is 30D. So, 30/9 = 3D20M

> 4th house represents Mother (moon)
>> A Nakshatra is 13D20M. So 13,20/4 = 3D20M.

WE ARE JUST REPRESENTED BY **1 PADA**

> There are **4 padas** per nakshatra (total of 27 nakshatras). So **27*4 = 108**. There are **9 padas** per rasi(total of 12 rasis). So **9*12 = 108**
